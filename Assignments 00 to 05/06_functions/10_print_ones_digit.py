# Write a function called print_ones_digit , which takes as a parameter an integer num and prints its ones digit. The modulo (remainder) operator, %, should be helpful to you here. Call your function from main()!

# Here's a sample run (user input is in blue):

# Enter a number: 42 The ones digit is 2

def main():
    print("Delete this line and write your code here! :)")


# This provided line is required at the end of
# Python file to call the main() function.
