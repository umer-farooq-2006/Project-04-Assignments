# Fill out the function get_last_element(lst) which takes in a list lst as a parameter and prints the last element in the list. The list is guaranteed to be non-empty, but there are no guarantees on its length.z

# Takes the length of the list and minuses 1 since they are zero-indexed (we start counting at 0)
print(list[len(list) - 1])

# The line below works too!!
# print(lst[-1])
